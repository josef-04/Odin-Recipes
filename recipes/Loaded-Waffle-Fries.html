    <img src="../materials/loaded waffle frise.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>Discrebtion</h2>
    <p>These loaded waffle fries are topped with all of your favorite bacon cheeseburger fixingsâ€”burger-seasoned beef, Cheddar, bacon, and all the right condiments. This serves 2 as a main dish or 6 for a game day snack. If you cannot find Worcestershire pub burger seasoning, just use Montreal steak seasoning.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dill pickle relish</li>
        <li>12 ounces frozen waffle fries</li>
        <li>2 slices thick cut bacon</li>
        <li>8 ounces lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 Roma tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, and dill pickle relish in a small bowl. Set sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil, and arrange waffle fries on the sheet in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Bake fries in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes, or according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into the skillet, sprinkle with Worcestershire pub burger seasoning, and cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes. Drain in a colander.</li>
        <li>Divide beef among the cooked fries and top with cheese. Return baking sheet to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top fries with lettuce, tomato, onion, and bacon. Drizzle reserved sauce over the top and serve immediately.</li>
